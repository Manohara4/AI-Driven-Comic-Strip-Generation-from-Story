# AI-Driven-Comic-Strip-Generation-from-Story

How to Run This Project Follow these steps to run the AI-driven comic strip generation project using Google Colab:

Open Google Colab in your browser.
Sign in with your Google account if you're not already logged in.
Click on "File" -> "New notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.
Go to "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type". In the popup window, set the Hardware accelerator to T4 GPU (or any available GPU). Click "Save".
Open the GitHub repository and copy the code cells into your Colab notebook in order.
Create a new Groq API by Signing in to Groq Website and Place it in the Code.
Run all the cells one by one or choose "Runtime" -> "Run all".
When prompted, input your story and select a manga style as instructed.
The AI will process your input and automatically generate a comic strip based on your story.
Tips & Notes

Recommended Browser: Use Google Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility with Google Colab.
Colab Timeout: Google Colab may disconnect if idle for too long. Stay active or occasionally interact with the notebook to avoid losing progress.
Input Formatting: Write clear and coherent stories in English for best comic generation results. Avoid slang, shorthand, or overly complex sentences.
Style Selection: Choose a manga style that fits your story theme (e.g., fantasy, manga, cartoon). This can enhance the visual coherence of the strip.
GPU Quotas: If Colab doesn't provide a GPU (e.g., T4), wait a few hours or try again later. Free users have limited GPU access.
Saving Your Work: Download the generated comic strip after creation, as Colab sessions reset and data may be lost.
